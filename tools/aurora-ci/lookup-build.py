"""Name a kernel build by its inputs and find earlier results for it.

A build is identified by what goes into it: the kernel tree without the CI
itself (.github and tools/aurora-ci never reach the package), and the parts
of omarchy-pkgs that build it (the linux-aurora recipe, the builder image
definition, bin/build and the helpers it sources). The same key means the
same package, so CI never builds or tests one twice; a change to the CI
alone, or to omarchy-pkgs outside those parts, reuses the last build. What
the key cannot see (package updates in the Arch Linux ARM repositories the
builder installs from) is what the nightly rebuild is for.

  kernel-package-<key>     the packages and their metadata (reused instead of
                           building again)
  kernel-verified-<key>    written when every full-run job passed; a later
                           run with the same key skips KUnit and the boot test
  kernel-metadata-<id>     package metadata for a kernel (its tree without
                           the CI), the baseline a later change is compared with

This script computes the key, pins the omarchy-pkgs commit it was computed
from, and looks those artifacts up through the Actions API. It accepts only
artifacts that kernel-ci.yml uploaded after review: from the branch, the
merge queue, the nightly run or a manual run of the branch (see
TRUSTED_EVENTS). The one exception is the merge queue: it also accepts the
build and verification of a pull request run at the very head it is merging,
the code its reviewers approved, when that run tested exactly the tree being
merged (see pull_request_run).
